		<p class="center-left">Click <a href="http://www.fastpagescroll.com">here</a> for a demonstration of the functionality. Please note, that Fast Page Scroll doesn't work by default on the Chrome webstore, or in this help page, because of browser restrictions.</p>
		<h1>How to use Fast Page Scroll</h1>
		<p class="center-left">Double click on the top right corner (roughly at a third) of the page to quickly scroll up to the top. Double click on the bottom right corner to scroll down. On pages with infinite scrolling (like Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest etc.) keep double clicking at the bottom to load more and more content.</p>
